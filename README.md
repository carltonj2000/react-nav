# React Navigation

The code in this repository is based on the
[React Native Navigation for Mobile Applications](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-native-course-overview-react-native-navigation-for-mobile-applications)
course.

The repository for the course is
[here](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/react-native-navigation-for-mobile-applications/tree/05-react-native-open-a-modal-from-tab-bar-in-react-navigation).

Did not finish trying out the following code:

- Open a Modal from Tab Bar in React Navigation
- Override Default Transitions in React Native with StackNavigator's transitionConfig Object
- Build Fine-grained Screen Transitions with a Custom React Navigation Interpolator
- Replace a Screen with React Navigation

The last item in this list is important because it shows how to change the navigation call stack.
